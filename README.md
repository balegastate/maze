# maze
Dijkstra's algorithm on a maze

I'm running:
-- Python 3.6.4 --
-- Pillow 6.1.0 --


The image you want to process must be named "in.png"
Output image will be saved as "out.png"

Rules of the maze:
-Walls are colored black
-Path is colored white
-Entrance must be in the first row of the image
-Exit must be in the last row of the image
